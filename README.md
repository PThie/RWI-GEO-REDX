# RWI-GEO-REDX: A Housing Price Index

This repository shows the detailed preparation and generation of RWI-GEO-REDX price index.

## Abstract Data Description (v11)

The FDZ Ruhr at RWI provides price indices for apartments and houses (rentals and sales) in
Germany starting in 2008. The price indices are based on the real estate dataset RWI-GEO-RED,
which combines real estate listings from ImmoScout24. We perform three types of hedonic regressions to allow comparisons across time (annual or quarterly), across regions (labor market regions, counties, or municipalities), and in combination across time and regions. The data are publicly available and can be requested from the FDZ Ruhr website. A weakly anonymized version is also available for researchers on request. This data report is an updated version of previous reports and refers to RWI-GEO-REDX v11,
which covers data until May 2023.

## Access

The dataset RWI-GEO-REDX is available as Public Use File free of charge for all. Researchers can also be provided with the dataset as a Scientific Use File. The SUF differs from the PUF in the number of observations needed to calculate the price index. Only after a minimum number of 50 observations (per municipality) the price index is shown in the PUF. For the SUF already 5 observations are sufficient.
